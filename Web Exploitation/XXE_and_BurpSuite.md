## XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks

### Introduction to XXE
XML External Entity (XXE) is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input. The attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. This can lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server-side request forgery (SSRF), port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts.

### How XXE Works
XXE attacks exploit the XML standard and its features for defining external entities. External entities allow an XML document to include data from an external source.

#### Example of Vulnerable XML
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ 
<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

In the example above, the XML includes an external entity declaration that references the file `/etc/passwd`. When the XML parser processes this document, it attempts to include the contents of `/etc/passwd` in place of the `&xxe;` entity.

### Types of XXE Attacks
1. **File Disclosure**: Extracting sensitive files from the server.
2. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Making the server perform unauthorized requests.
3. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Using external entities to cause a DoS condition.
4. **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: In rare cases, XXE can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

### Example Attack Scenarios
#### File Disclosure
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
  <!ELEMENT data ANY>
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<data>&xxe;</data>
```

#### SSRF
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
  <!ELEMENT data ANY>
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://internalserver.local/secret">
]>
<data>&xxe;</data>
```

### Preventing XXE Attacks
1. **Disable External Entities**: Configure the XML parser to disallow external entities.
2. **Use Less Complex Data Formats**: Use JSON or other data formats that do not support external entities.
3. **Validate and Sanitize Input**: Ensure that the XML input is properly validated and sanitized.
4. **Use Secure Libraries**: Utilize libraries and parsers that are known to be secure against XXE.

### Example Prevention in Code (Java)
```java
DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
dbf.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);
DocumentBuilder db = dbf.newDocumentBuilder();
Document doc = db.parse(new InputSource(new StringReader(xml)));
```

## Burp Suite

### Introduction to Burp Suite
Burp Suite is a comprehensive platform for web application security testing. Its various tools work seamlessly together to support the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of an application's attack surface to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities.

### Key Features of Burp Suite
1. **Spider**: Automatically crawls web applications.
2. **Scanner**: Automatically detects vulnerabilities.
3. **Intruder**: Automates customized attacks against web applications.
4. **Repeater**: Manually modify and re-send individual requests.
5. **Sequencer**: Analyzes the quality of randomness in application sessions.
6. **Decoder**: Decodes data that has been encoded or obfuscated.
7. **Comparer**: Performs a comparison of any two items (e.g., responses).
8. **Extender**: Allows you to load Burp extensions.

### Using Burp Suite
#### Setting Up Burp Suite
1. **Proxy Configuration**: Configure your browser to use Burp Suite as a proxy.
2. **CA Certificate**: Install Burp's CA certificate in your browser to intercept HTTPS traffic.

#### Basic Workflow
1. **Intercepting Requests**: Use the proxy to capture and inspect HTTP/HTTPS traffic between your browser and the target application.
2. **Scanning for Vulnerabilities**: Run the automated scanner to identify common vulnerabilities.
3. **Manual Testing with Repeater**: Send individual requests through Repeater to manually test for vulnerabilities.
4. **Automated Attacks with Intruder**: Use Intruder to automate attacks like brute-forcing, parameter fuzzing, etc.

### Example: Intercepting and Modifying a Request
1. **Capture the Request**: Use the Proxy tab to intercept a login request.
2. **Send to Repeater**: Right-click the intercepted request and send it to Repeater.
3. **Modify and Send**: Modify parameters (e.g., username, password) in Repeater and resend the request to test different inputs.

### Example: Using Intruder for Brute Force
1. **Set Up Attack**: Capture a login request and send it to Intruder.
2. **Define Positions**: Mark the parameters you want to attack (e.g., username, password).
3. **Load Payloads**: Load a list of usernames or passwords as payloads.
4. **Start Attack**: Run the attack and analyze the results to find valid credentials.

### Extensions and Customization
Burp Suite allows for extensive customization through extensions. Extensions can be written in Java, Python, or Ruby and can be used to enhance the functionality of Burp Suite.

### Conclusion
Burp Suite is an essential tool for web application security testing. Its powerful features and extensibility make it a preferred choice for security professionals worldwide.
